## Project Overview

This repository contains the source files for the **Comprehensive Market Analysis and Strategic Business Development Report**, which includes an in-depth analysis of sales data using SQL queries and visualized insights through Tableau dashboards. The primary goal is to identify market opportunities, optimize resource allocation, and provide strategic recommendations to drive business growth.

### Key Components:
- Market Analysis: Analyzes regional and product-specific sales data using SQL to understand strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT Analysis).
- Market Segmentation: Breaks down the market by geographic, product, and behavioral segmentation to optimize marketing and product strategies.
- Trend Analysis: Identifies monthly sales trends and day-of-the-week performance to help plan marketing campaigns and resource allocation.
- Strategy Development: Provides growth opportunities, risk mitigation strategies, and competitive positioning recommendations.
- Interactive Dashboard: A Tableau dashboard titled "Sales Trends and Performance Insights Dashboard" to visualize key metrics.

## Files in This Repository

- `report.pdf`: LaTeX source file for the comprehensive report.
- `SQL_queries.sql`: SQL scripts used to query the sales data for analysis.
- `dashboard.twb`: Tableau workbook file for the interactive dashboard.
- `retail_sales.csv`: Folder containing the sales data used for analysis.


## Requirements

To work with this project, ensure you have the following software and tools installed:


1. PostgreSQL: For running the SQL queries and managing the database.
2. Tableau: For viewing and interacting with the dashboard.
3. Git: For version control and collaboration.

### Software Versions:

- PostgreSQL: Version 12.x or later
- Tableau: Version 2020.x or later


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Setting Up the Database:
- Install PostgreSQL and set up a new database instance.
- Use the SQL script (`SQL_queries.sql`) to load the data into the database and perform analysis.
- Ensure the data from the `data/` folder is properly imported into the database tables.

### 2. Running the Interactive Dashboard:
- Open the `dashboard.twb` file in Tableau to view the "Sales Trends and Performance Insights Dashboard."
- Use the dashboard filters to explore sales data trends by region, product category, and time period.

### 4. SQL Queries:
- The `SQL_queries.sql` file contains all the SQL queries used for analysis. You can modify and run these queries in PostgreSQL to extract further insights from the dataset.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Exploring the Data:
- Navigate through the pdf report to review the analysis and findings.
- Use the Tableau dashboard to interact with the data, filter views by region or product, and observe trends over time.

### 2. Customizing the Report:
- Customize the SQL queries in the `SQL_queries.sql` file to extract additional insights from the sales data.
